Personal Site. It was created to use it as a portfolio and opportunity to research about new technologies. 


# Live site
https://www.nicolastudela.dev/

The site will mainly provide information about myself, my work experience and some sort of blog, where users can post something.

**The project is still on its early stage** 

Mutable data, users, and auth flows are be handled by an API (built by me)  -> https://github.com/nicolastudela/solari

## Responsive desing supporting 2 breakpoints

The site responds well to several resolutions but for sake of simplicity it was build to support two main layouts mobile & non-mobile.
