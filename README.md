Personal Site. It was created to use it as a portfolio and opportunity to try and research about new technologies. 

## Project title
The site will mainly provide information about myself, my work experience and some sort of blog, where users can post something.

**The project is still on its early stage** 

Data about resume and users flow will be handled by hitting an API that also on constrution -> https://github.com/nicolastudela/solari

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Hooks)
- [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Webpack 4] 
- [React-Router]
- [Emotion.js]
- [Material.UI]
- [SmoothUI]

**Need to define what architecture to use in terms of state management. I'm trying to move from flux-like (redux); And might try
apollo-client or just doing some vanilla implementation (with hooks). Apollo-Client might be a little bit overkill. But it can 
be a good way to tackle api calls and also state management. TBD**
