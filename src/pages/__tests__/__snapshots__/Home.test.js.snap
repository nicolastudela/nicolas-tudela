            I find in Javascript a powerfull language where it gives you the
              chance to work on both backend and frontend sides seamlessly. It has a
              huge commutity support and it's constantly evolving to make develop experience great

            Specialization its great to achieve complex problems but having in-depth knowledge and experience of on every topic related to the app development gives you a 360 degree view, which it's useful to get a better understanding of the project requirements

            Throughout my work experience, I learned the importance of having good communication skills, paying attention to detail and building reliable code. 
          My career started as a Java developer but these last few years I’ve switched to Javascript and I’m loving it.

        The keys to creating meaningful and lasting relationships are transparency, authenticity and openness. Expectations must be set, shared and clarified.
        <br />
        <br />
         Open and frequent communication is fundamental. Having proper communication tools such as slack and zoom helps a lot. Holding regular meetings as well as practicing Agile methodologies is a must.
        <br />
        <br />
         Trust is another important key. We definitely have to build trust. That is why we have to be as transparent and clear as possible. Ongoing communication and having personal or off-topic chats can help too.
